# scala-lisp

A partial implementation of Lisp/Scheme based on [Write You A Scheme 2.0](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/00_overview.html) ported from Haskell to Scala using pure functional programming techniques with [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), [cats effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) and [cats monad transformers](https://typelevel.org/cats-mtl/).

It includes an interactive REPL, file system access and its own standard library.
